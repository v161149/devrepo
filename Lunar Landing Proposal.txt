1. Project Title : Artificial Intelligent Lunar Landing Fuel Control System

2. Situation/Problem/Opportunity: 

   On June 2, 2019, NASA celebrated the 50th anniversary of the historic 
   Apollo 11 Moon mission and looked to the future of exploration on the 
   Moon and Mars.

   50 years ago, On 20 July 1969, astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin experienced 
   some of the scariest moments of first manned moon landing. The Apollo 11 
   lunar module was on its historic descent to the moon’s crater-pocked 
   surface when a fuel light blinked on. Still 100ft (30 metres) above the 
   ground, it was not what the astronauts needed. The Eagle’s tank was nearly 
   dry. Armstrong taken control of the lunar module at the late stage and 
   was carefully steering the craft down. They almost ran out of fuel.

3. Purpose Statement (Goals):
   The overarching goals of this project are to develope an optimized fuel 
   control software algorithm using Artificial Intelligent to make lunar 
   module save as much of fuel when landing on Moon in the near future.

4. Objectives/Deliverables (if known):
   Develope a Machine Learning algorithm to opertimize fuel control system of
   lunar moduel.

5. Methods/Approach:

   1. Research different kinds of Artificial Intelligent Approaches.
   2. Develop AI algrithm using Java programming language
   3. Use Open source Deep Learning 4 Java library
   4. Use Spark Big data plateform to do data computation
